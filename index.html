	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p></p>
			<p>The popularity of movies stems form the fact they let people escape reality and fully engage in a new, interesting story of their choice. 
				However, it is very difficult to predict whether a movie will be good or bad before watching it. 
				A movie&#39s success is often measured by how much money it brings in or the ratings it receives from viewers, 
				but none of this information is known until far after the movie is released. The goal of this project is to 
				investigate what movie factors are strongly correlated with a movie&#39s revenue, and to identify any patterns that emerge from a country-level 
				analysis of these factors.  </p>

			<p>
				The dataset I used originates from <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset> Kaggle </a> and includes information on over 
				48,000 movies including the title, genre, budget, revenue brought in, average review score and number of votes, production country, and much more. 
				All movies included in the dataset were released before July 2017. <br><br><br><br><br>

	These superfluous divs/spans were originally provided as catch-alls to add extra imagery.
	These days we have full ::before and ::after support, favour using those instead.
	These only remain for historical design compatibility. They might go away one day.
