	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>Production Country Breakdown</h3>
            <p></p>
			<p>The first element I investigated was the breakdown of movies produced in each country. 
                Below is a Tableau dashboard consisting of a choropleth showing the number of movies produced in each country 
                and a filterable bar graph ranking the countries with the most movies. The interactive dashboard can be 
                found <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bryce.whitney/viz/NumberofMoviesProducedinEachCountry/MoviesDashboard?publish=yes">here</a>.    </p>

            <div> The Tableau dashboard showing the number of movies produced by each country. 
                If a movie was produced in multiple countries, it is included in the count for both countries.  </div>
        </div>

        <div class="text" id="zen-text" role="article">
			<p>
				The most obvious observation is that the United States produces significantly more movies than any other country in this data. 
                4,301 movies were produced in the United States, while the United Kingdom was second with only 666 movies. Once you get outside 
                the top ten countries, no country produced more than 73 movies. It is also interesting to note that all the top 5 countries come 
                from North America and Europe. It is unclear whether this is due to data availability, cultural views on movies, or some other factor, 
                but could be interesting to explore in the future.

	These superfluous divs/spans were originally provided as catch-alls to add extra imagery.
	These days we have full ::before and ::after support, favour using those instead.
	These only remain for historical design compatibility. They might go away one day.
