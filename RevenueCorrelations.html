	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>Factors Associated with Revenue</h3>
            <p></p>
			<p>From the start I was interested in exploring how different components and factors in movies are correlated with a movie&#39s revenue, 
                as revenue is often used as a metric to determine the success or failure of a movie. Specifically, I decided to explore a movie&#39s budget, 
                runtime, and average voter score were correlated with a movie&#39s revenue. Movies with missing data in any of those 4 fields were not included, 
                leaving 5360 movies to be analyzed.   </p>
        </div>

        <div class="correlationImage">
            <img src="figures/RevenueCorrelations.png" width="1000" height="600">
            <div> A heatmap showing the correlation coefficient between each variable and revenue, 
                and a corresponding hexbin plot for each variable. </div>
        </div>

        <div class="text" id="zen-text" role="article">
			<p>
				From the above figure, we see that budget has the strongest linear correlation with revenue, boasting a correlation coefficient of 0.73. 
                This isn&#39t too surprising because I would expect movies with higher budgets to have better actors and actresses, better special effects, 
                better advertising, and simply allow for a better product overall. Contrarily, a movie&#39s runtime and average score have very weak correlations 
                with revenue. This is corroborated by the hexbin plots where for average score and runtime loosely follow skewed normal distributions, yet there is
                 a clear positive linear trend in the budget hexbin plot. While causation can&#39t be extracted from the data, it does highlight that budget could be 
                 one of the most important factors for predicting how much money a movie will bring in.
