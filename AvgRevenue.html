	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>Country Breakdown of Average Revenue</h3>
            <p></p>
			<p>The next element I investigated was the country&#39s average revenue for a movie. Below is a Tableau dashboard consisting of a 
                choropleth showing a movie&#39s average revenue when produced in each country and a filterable bar graph ranking the countries with the 
                highest average revenue per movie. The interactive dashboard can be found 
                <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bryce.whitney/viz/AverageMovieRevenueinEachCountry/RevenueDashboard?publish=yes">here</a>.    </p>

            <div> The Tableau dashboard showing each country&#39s average movie revenue. 
                Only countries that produced at least 5 movies were included in the bar graph.   </div>
        </div>

        <div class="text" id="zen-text" role="article">
			<p>
				Despite only producing 5 movies, Malta boasted the highest average movie revenue bringing in over 
                $421 million on average. Of the countries that appeared in the top 10 for number of movies produced, only 4 of them also 
                appear in the top 10 for average movie revenue (China, United Kingdom, United States, and Australia). This suggest that quantity 
                doesn&#39t always lead to quality when producing movies.

	These superfluous divs/spans were originally provided as catch-alls to add extra imagery.
	These days we have full ::before and ::after support, favour using those instead.
	These only remain for historical design compatibility. They might go away one day.
