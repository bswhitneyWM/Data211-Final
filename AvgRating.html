	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h3>Country Breakdown of Movie Ratings</h3>
            <p></p>
			<p>The final element I investigated was the country&#39s average score for a movie. Below is a Tableau dashboard consisting of a 
                choropleth showing a movie&#39s average voter score when produced in each country, and a filterable bar graph ranking the countries 
                with the highest average score. The interactive dashboard can be found 
                <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bryce.whitney/viz/AverageMovieRatinginEachCountry/AverageVoteDashboard?publish=yes">here</a>.    </p>
        </div>

        <div class="correlationImage">

            <div> The Tableau dashboard showing each country&#39s average movie score. Valid scores fall in the range between 0 and 10. 
                Only countries that produced at least 5 movies were included in the bar graph.    </div>
        </div>

        <div class="text" id="zen-text" role="article">
			<p>
				The average movie ratings between countries are significantly more clumped together than the number of movies 
                produced and average revenue are. Turkey, with an average score of 7.257, deserves recognition for being the only country 
                with an average score over 7,  but the difference between Israel in the second spot and Norway in the tenth spot is only .33. 
                In fact, no country with at least 5 movies drops below an average rating of 5.4. From the choropleth map we see a lot of countries 
                in South America and Africa have very high average ratings, but since most of these countries don&#39t show up on the bar chart, it suggests 
                these high ratings may be due to producing one or two good movies and nothing else, which is corroborated by the histogram in the tool tip.
